# VisionAI: CameraX-Based Android Application

## Overview

VisionAI is an Android mobile application built with Android Studio that uses the CameraX API for capturing real-time video frames. These frames are processed using a generative AI API to analyze and understand the content. The application then uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) to describe out loud what the AI detects in the scene, offering an innovative and interactive way to explore visual environments.

## Features

- **Real-Time Frame Capture**: Utilizes CameraX for efficient and responsive video capture.
- **AI-Powered Frame Analysis**: Integrates with a generative AI API to process and understand the visual data in real-time.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts AI-generated descriptions into speech, providing audible feedback on what the camera sees.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for seamless interaction.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Antonini877/ai-cam-assistent-app
